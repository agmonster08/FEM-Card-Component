## My process

-Do typography & Font size, Weight
-select where to use CSS Grid and FlexBox
-Add spacing such as margin and padding.
-Finally colors & ser media queries for mobile.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Learned how to properly place the image, for mobile. That was the most challenging part as i couldn't get the alignment correctly for the pictures,
also the margins outside for the background of the card.


### Continued development
Would like to get the dimensions for mobile better would surely update it. 
my next step would be to do a component that's more complicated to use CSS Grid columns & grid tracks.
